        <p>MBBS, MD, BDS, BAMS, BHMS(DOCTOR)
            All of them cannot treat them, it is not their subject. Not all of them have knowledge of this disease. Its treatment is possible only through speech therapy, thousands of people have corrected their voice through speech therapy and are living happy lives today. You can take their numbers from us, you can take videos of them who are speaking 100 percent correctly and clearly today. Here its treatment is with guarantee. Provided (but you have to follow the speech therapy completely (complete course), you will be absolutely 100 percent cured.              </p>
            <p style="color: rgb(138, 21, 33);">Can its treatment be done everywhere?</p><p> 
                Proper treatment is available only at 4 to 5 places in India. The treatment of stammering started around 1990, before that there was no treatment for it, hence earlier people used to rightly say that there is no treatment for it. It is not a disease, there is no medicine for it, so its treatment is not available everywhere.
                For complete recovery, a long course has to be done, which is possible only at the centre.</p>
