           <h4 style="color: rgb(138, 21, 33);">What is stuttering?</h4> 
                <p>Stuttering is not by birth, stammering is by birth. 100% children stammer from birth but 99% children get cured automatically but stammering happens due to some reason, breathing plays a major role in speaking. Your breathing becomes short or your breathing gets fragmented, then you speak at a higher speed in short breaths and stammer, and when you stutter continuously, it gets stuck in your mind that I stammer, later this becomes your psychology. And you are not able to speak clearly. You are intelligent, educated, you apply your mind, adopt all the methods, speak slowly but are not able to speak properly because you do not know even 1% about it.
             <br> <br> <p style="color: rgb(138, 21, 33);" >  There are 4 reasons for short breathing-</p>
             <ol type="1"> <li> Physical weakness or any major or prolonged illness in childhood, like typhoid, asthma, jaundice etc.
                </li><li> There is someone stammering in the family who taught you to speak or you imitated him.
               </li> <li> Because of fear, you may have been bullied a lot in your childhood.
               </li> <li> Or any major accident or mishap has happened to you. Stuttering first occurs in childhood, before the age of 10 years.
                Stuttering increases with age in 90% of people and decreases in 10% of people.</li></ol>

    <p>
       <ol type="1">   <li>  Your breathing becomes shorter and your breathing becomes fragmented.</li>
        <li>  The speed of your speaking increases.</li>
            <li> Words become heavy (difficult) for you and become your enemies,
            Can't speak words or say one word multiple times. </li> <li> Self-confidence decreases or disappears. to tell you right
            There is no faith. You are afraid to speak and you feel embarrassed
            it occurs.</li>
        <li> Can't speak. This becomes your psychology.
            , Stuttering is not in the mouth but in the mind, it gets stuck in your mind, I am right.</li>
            <li> Your speaking habits become wrong.
            Therefore, it cannot be treated with medicines; it cannot be treated by eating almonds, gooseberries and doing yoga.
            Because these are the 6 reasons why medicine does not work.</li></ol>  </p>
           <li> <p style="color: rgb(138, 21, 33);">How does stuttering progress?</p></li><p>
                When you are not able to speak properly continuously, you stammer, then you select some words that I cannot speak at all and when those words come to speak, then you are not able to speak at all and get stuck, due to this your stammering keeps on increasing. Is. Then when you get stuck in saying water, then you change the word and say water instead of water, this is not the solution. Doing this increases stuttering. And your speaking confidence keeps decreasing.
                Stuttering is not a disease but a bad habit. Due to stuttering, you may face problems in marriage even if you have qualifications. One has to face a lot of problems in business and job also. Sometimes you become so upset that you even think of committing suicide. A person who stutters also has a lot of anger.
                </p>
               <li> <p style="color: rgb(138, 21, 33);">Why do you stop at the first word?</p></li><p>
                    The speed of your speaking is high, you try to speak four or five words together, due to short breathing and high speed, your tongue is not able to form proper words, you do not have the confidence to speak, and you fail to speak the first word. But they get stuck or say the first word four to five times or the word itself has to be changed. you can't speak and get stuck
                    </p></p>
                <li> <p style="color: rgb(138, 21, 33);">Why don't you stammer while singing?</p></li><p>
                    While singing, you take full breath to complete the line of the song and your attention gets absorbed in the rhythm and beat of the song. Your psychology i.e. your attention gets diverted from stammering and you do not stutter while singing. If there was any problem with your tongue or mouth, you would stammer even while singing and if you were alone in the room, you would speak absolutely correctly, hence there is no problem with your tongue or mouth.
                   <br> If you stammer a lot then your speed is around 130 to 150. If you stammer less then your speed is 80 to 90. A normal person speaks correctly at a speed of 40 to 50. We reduce your speed through speech rep and lengthen your breathing and teach you to speak correctly through continuous daily practice. This improves your psychology and you start speaking properly. And your confidence starts increasing.
